# Hangman

This program was written in steps after creating a flowchart. ASCII art supplied and included in this repository.

* Indicated in comments - the clear screen function from replit does not work in Spyder where this code was tested: please uncomment and run in Repl.it with the two files supplied and indicated for the program.

* You can customise the included hangman_words dictionary if you wish by adding to it or using words from a different language.

* This is the first time a while loop is used with a boolean value to keep the program running.

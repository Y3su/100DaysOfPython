# Caesar cipher

* In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

* Deciphering is done in reverse, with a right shift of 3.

This program was developed in steps by breaking it down in small TODO tasks which were identified in the flow chart.

* The user chooses whether to encrypt or decrypt and the cipher key is entered. The program will run again if the user wants to en/decrypt something else.

* The module art.py is in this repository - ASCII art needed for the program to run.
